In a CSS file, any <div> created using the "Generate" button should have a Red background-color.

Clicking a "Swap" <button> should change its parent background-color from Red to Yellow.

Clicking the "Swap" <button> again should turn the color back to Red.

Clicking a "Delete" <button> should remove its parent <div> container (and all of its contents).
